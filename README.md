# Tailorz
Tailorz is a feature-rich Android application designed to bridge the gap between customers and tailors, offering an intuitive and efficient platform where customers can browse, chat, and connect with tailors, while tailors can seamlessly manage their clients and services. Customers can explore professional tailors with detailed profiles, start real-time chats for custom tailoring requests, and view tailor details in a dedicated profile screen. Tailors can efficiently manage customer interactions through an organized customer list, receive and respond to chat messages, and showcase their professional profiles with images and categories. The app integrates a real-time chat system powered by Firebase, enabling seamless communication between customers and tailors. It features a modern UI/UX design with View Binding for better efficiency and utilizes Glide for high-performance profile image loading. With Firebase integration, the app ensures real-time database management, secure authentication, and efficient data handling. Built using Java for Android, it leverages Firebase Realtime Database for backend operations and follows a structured UI/UX approach using XML, ConstraintLayout, and View Binding, along with essential libraries such as Glide and Firebase SDK.
